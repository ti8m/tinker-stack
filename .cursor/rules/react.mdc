# Rules for authoring React components

- React is not just a UI framework but also a concept of how a UI is composed. Information should only flow downwards (One-Way dataflow). Never break this concept.
- Only trigger updates through events / actions or handlers.
- Avoid Refs to a child component. Use Props / Context instead and have the child component react to a change in props. Never trigger changes on a different component explicitly.
- React uses functional concepts instead of OOP concepts.
- Components and Hooks must be pure.
- Prefer useReducer over multiple useStates in the same component.
- Document the code in a way that you still understand it a year later.
