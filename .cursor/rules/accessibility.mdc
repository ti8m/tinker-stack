# Accessibility Rules

All UI components in must comply with the WCAG 2.1 AA standard.

- For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.
- Non-native user interactive components need their `role` attribute set. Pay attention to nested components and also take the role of parent components into account.
- Non-native user interactive components which can be in different UI states, need to be annotated with WAI-ARIA state and property attributes where possible.
- Interactive components need to be labelled either via label elements or through `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
- Do not add noise and information that is not relevant to a user.
- Avoid redundancy. Verify that there are no duplicated annotations. Also check parent and child components.
- Keyboard navigation needs to work in all components.
- User focus needs to be properly guided.
- New titles need to be localized.
- Interactive elements cannot contain other interactive elements.

Do not forget to also update the tests for a component.

Use the class `sr-only` for elements that should only be visible to screenreaders.
